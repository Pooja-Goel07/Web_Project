## *Project Overview*

HelpMap aims to bridge the gap between individuals who want to contribute to social causes and NGOs that need support. By providing a centralized platform, the application eliminates the hassle of repeatedly searching for NGOs by category. It also includes features like NGO listings, campaigns, media resources, and contact forms that allow users to comfortably raise their queries or reach out to us directly via email.

## *Features*

- **Landing Page**: A visually engaging homepage featuring sections like Navbar, Hero Section, Jumbotron, Featured NGOs, and Footer.
- **About Us**: Comprehensive insight into the platform’s mission, vision, and values.
- **Featured NGOs**: A categorized showcase of verified NGOs working in sectors such as education, environment, and health.
- **Media Center**: Displays available visuals such as photos and banners, showcasing progress and project snapshots.
- **Campaigns Page**: Users can search for verified NGOs and the domains they are interested in. Clicking on the NGO redirects the user to the NGO's official page for more details.
- **Contact Us**: A user-friendly form enabling users to reach out directly. Includes integrated email sending via EmailJS and PDF download of submitted queries using jsPDF.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across platforms.

---

## *Technologies Used*

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap (for responsiveness)  
- **Libraries & APIs**:
  - **EmailJS**: For sending emails directly from the contact form without a backend  
  - **jsPDF**: For generating and downloading the user's submitted queries as PDF files  
- **Tools**: GitHub for version control.

> ⚠️ Note: Since Bootstrap uses CDN, a stable internet connection is recommended for proper functioning of styles and responsiveness.
